# About

This is a simple Library Management System web-application, intended to be used as a platform to learn using JPA via Spring Data framework.

# Objectives

* Expose a REST API to explore the library, manage books and users and track their usage/availability.
* Use a simple Database to maintain the Users and Books via Spring Data JPA.

# Requirements

* Provide a simple frontend for the users to login/browse/borrow/return books.
* Accomodate two types of users
    * Library users who can borrow/return books
    * Librarians who can administer the library online.
* Let Librarians set restrictions on which (set of) user(s) can access what books, how many books a user can borrow at any given time, the time for which a book can be borrowed and how many times a user can borrow a book, etc.,
